## Exploring Product Ownership through exercises

Using [Protobot](http://molly.is/experimenting/protobot/#)  (a random generator for product ideas) I will attempt to create User Stories, MVP and Epics for generated topic. 
The goal is to apply concepts learned for Product Owner responsbilities, build creative energy and recieve any feedback or coaching oppurtunities that exist.

### How you can help

* Get a [GitHub account](http://github.com).
* Watch or Star this repo. This may help me achieve some visibility.
* You can interact with the text and the rest directly from the web here:(
  you can comment on text and changes in it (called *commits*).
* You can also request changes on the text using [*issues*](https://github.com/JJ/hoborg/issues). If you find
  an error of any kind, just raise an issue and I'll fix it (or try
  to).
* Create your own version: once forked, you can use git (check out
  this manual http://wiki.freegeek.org/index.php/Git_for_dummies ) to
  branch and evolve the story in whichever way you want.
* If you think there is a worthwhile addition do a Pull Request.
  
  

### Current Approach (Open to Suggestions/Recommendations)


**Task**: 
Use [Protobot](http://molly.is/experimenting/protobot/#) to generate idea 

**Suggested Approach** / (Open to recommendations)


   Step 1: Write down all the user stories which your product may end up having. Each user story must end with the user capturing value from the product.

   Step 2: Prioritize the user stories according to value and difficulty of execution. Apply and explain Prioritization Model.

   Step 3: According to the user story selected (or stories) drill down to understand which features you MUST develop. That is going to be the MVP.
   
## Exercises 

### Number 1

#### Step 1 Build User Stories:
       As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >.
       
       As a user I want to mop floors 
       As a user I want to wax floors
       As a user I want different mop head attachments 
       As a user I want to upload shift schedule so that date is arranged [before/after] work.
       As a user I want to interface with largest dating site today (We'll assume eHarmony)
       As a user I want to interface with existing dating sites
       As a user I want search for popular events in my area
       As a user I want to schedule date for nearby bar/club
       As a user I want to be geo-verified and matched with people around 20 miles
       As a user I want voice activated appointment setting
       As a user I want to date other mop members and non-mop members
       As a user I want vibrating notifications to alert me of matches 
       As a user I want settings to elevate my seriousness in dating (one time hookups to marriage)
       As a user I want settings to control straight, LGBTQ etc
       As a user I want to take and upload photos from my mop
       As a user I want to confirm or deny date suggested.




#### Step 2 Priortize 
1. As a user I want to mop floors 
2. As a user I want to interface with existing dating sites
3. As a user I want to be geo-verified and matched with people around 20 miles
4. As a user I want to confirm or deny date suggested.
5. As a user I want vibrating notifications to alert me of matches 
6. As a user I want settings to elevate my seriousness in dating (one time hookups to marriage)
7. As a user I want settings to control straight, LGBTQ etc
8. As a user I want to upload shift schedule so that date is arranged [before/after] work.
9. As a user I want to schedule date for nearby bar/club
10. As a user I want search for popular events in my area
11. As a user I want voice activated appointment setting
12. As a user I want to wax floors
13. As a user I want different mop head attachments 
14. As a user I want to take and upload photos from my mop
15. As a user I want to date other mop members and non-mop members
16. As a user I want to interface with largest dating site today (We'll assume eHarmony)



#### Step 3 Create 

MVP will have first 3 items as a MVP

1. As a user I want to mop floors 
2. As a user I want to interface with existing dating sites
3. As a user I want to be geo-verified and matched with people around 20 miles

The mop will have standard stick and cotton bottom to mop floors. It will interface with the simplest API for a nearby dating site we can find and will use the location of mop use for deciding matches. Most of the match making will defer to local dating site's algorithm.
